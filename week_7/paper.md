# Title: Snapchat Bot Analysis: Evaluating its Ability to Confuse Users

# Abstract:
This short paper aims to analyze a Snapchat bot and assess its susceptibility to confusion. The study examines the bot's functionality, response patterns, and its ability to handle ambiguous or misleading queries. By testing its understanding and decision-making capabilities, we aim to determine if the bot can be easily confused or misled by users.

# Introduction:
The increasing prevalence of chatbots in social media platforms raises concerns about their effectiveness and potential vulnerabilities. This study focuses on a specific Snapchat bot and investigates its resilience to confusion. By understanding the bot's limitations, we can gain insights into potential risks and improve the design of future conversational agents.

# Methodology:
To evaluate the Snapchat bot's susceptibility to confusion, we designed a set of test scenarios that involve ambiguous queries, intentionally misleading information, and context-switching. Through interactions with the bot, we observed its responses, accuracy, and ability to detect and address confusion.

# Findings:
Our analysis revealed that the Snapchat bot demonstrates limited ability to handle complex or confusing queries. It often provides generic responses that do not effectively address user confusion. Additionally, the bot struggles to adapt to context-switching and frequently fails to recognize misleading information.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Snapchat bot analyzed in this study exhibits notable weaknesses when faced with confusing or misleading queries. While chatbots have made significant advancements in recent years, they still require further improvements to effectively handle user confusion. Enhancing the bot's contextual understanding and training it to identify and address misleading information would enhance its overall performance. Future research should focus on refining chatbot design and incorporating more robust algorithms to reduce the vulnerability to user confusion.
