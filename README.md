# ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments
As part of the criteria for completing the ArewaDS fellowship, this repository is created to fulfill the requirement.
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that uses data and algorithms to mimic how humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
Machine learning is important in data science because data scientists study transactional data using machine learning algorithms to make valuable predictions.
