Fairness-related harms
What do you mean by unfairness? "Unfairness" encompasses negative impacts, or "harms", for a group of people, such as those defined in terms of race, gender, age, or disability status.

The main fairness-related harms can be classified as:

Allocation, if a gender or ethnicity for example is favored over another.
Quality of service. If you train the data for one specific scenario but reality is much more complex, it leads to a poor performing service.
Stereotyping. Associating a given group with pre-assigned attributes.
Denigration. To unfairly criticize and label something or someone.
Over- or under- representation. The idea is that a certain group is not seen in a certain profession, and any service or function that keeps promoting that is contributing to harm.
